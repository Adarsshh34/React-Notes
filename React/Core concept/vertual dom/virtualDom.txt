✅ How Does React Use Virtual DOM?
1️⃣ Render Phase (in Memory)
    When your React component's state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree representing the UI after the change.
2️⃣ Diffing (Reconciliation)
    React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous Virtual DOM
    This is done using a diffing algorithm to identify changes (nodes added, removed, updated)
3️⃣ Commit Phase (DOM Updates)
    Only the changed elements are updated in the real DOM
    This process is called reconciliation

✅ Advantages of Virtual DOM:
    ✅ Improves performance by minimizing real DOM manipulations
    ✅ Makes React’s declarative approach possible
    ✅ Enables smooth UI updates even with complex changes



✅ 1️⃣ React — Uses Virtual DOM (VDOM)
    React creates a Virtual DOM tree on each render.
    Uses Diffing Algorithm (Reconciliation) to compare the old and new Virtual DOM.
    Only the minimal set of real DOM operations is applied.
    React’s approach is unidirectional data flow — you explicitly trigger updates via setState or hooks.
    💬 Key Point:
        React’s Virtual DOM is pure JavaScript object, and changes are applied only after diffing.

✅ 2️⃣ Vue.js — Uses Virtual DOM + Reactive System
    Vue also uses a Virtual DOM for efficient rendering, similar to React.
    But Vue has a reactive dependency tracking system (reactivity system)
    When a data property changes, Vue knows exactly which components depend on it.
    It updates only the necessary parts without traversing the entire Virtual DOM in many cases.
    💬 Key Difference from React:
        Vue combines Virtual DOM + Reactive Data System, so updates are more targeted and sometimes faster in smaller apps.

✅ 3️⃣ Angular — Does NOT use Virtual DOM (Uses Real DOM + Change Detection)
    Angular uses a change detection mechanism with real DOM updates.
    When data changes, Angular triggers change detection on the entire component tree.
    It compares the current model/state with the view and updates the real DOM if needed.
    Uses concepts like Zones (zone.js) to detect asynchronous changes.
    💬 Key Difference from React/Vue:
        Angular does not use Virtual DOM, it uses change detection + real DOM updates.
        It relies on its templating engine and bindings.
